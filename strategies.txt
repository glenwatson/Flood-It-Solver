unbury mode:
It is important to recognize which color still has one of it's own buried and try to avoid choosing that color until it is unburied. Therefore, thinking of it like Chess in the last 8 moves or so is crucial to beating it with extra moves left over. Which color is has the least buried and what would unburry it. If the one that would unbury it is also burried by another color then keep working backwards until you figure the best combination to finish off with.

Work backwards, then forwards.----Not layerable

Use all colours frequently rather than repeating the same colors within a few moves.
-or?- ----Do these work together?----Covered by recently used queue
Save one color for as long as you can, then save another color for as long as you can. - http://selearninggames.wikispaces.com/message/view/home/125308----If you can go around, should you go around?

Look for long chains of color.----Covered by search algorithm

Look for places to burst through checkerboard patterns.----Covered by farthest distance algorithm

Know when to change direction to tackle a built up area such as a busy cornor.----When it becomes the farthest point away

Completly clear a color----should be priority 1/have the highest weight

completely different approach http://markgritter.livejournal.com/673948.html

Pick 4 or 5 colors and act as if the remaining color(s) are walls. Find quickest path to cover all choosen colors. Select remaining colors and any other colors that are trapped.

Pick the nodes with the most neighbors

Pick the color that has the highest number of itself along the boarder
