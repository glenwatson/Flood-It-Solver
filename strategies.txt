unbury mode

know when to change direction to tackle a built up area such as a busy cornor.

Use all colours frequently rather than repeating the same colors within a few moves

look for long chains of color

Save one color for as long as you can, then same another color for as long as you can. - http://selearninggames.wikispaces.com/message/view/home/125308
